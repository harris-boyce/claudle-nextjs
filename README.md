## üöÄ Quick Start

> **"I created something cool in Claude Artifacts - now how do I make it a real app?"**

**[üìñ Complete Getting Started Guide ‚Üí](./docs/GETTING_STARTED.md)**

### **üåü Instant Start (Recommended)**
1. **Fork this repository**
2. **Click "Code" ‚Üí "Codespaces" ‚Üí "Create codespace"**
3. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for automatic setup
4. **Start learning** - everything pre-configured!

### **üîß Alternative Paths**
- **Local + DevContainer**: Isolated development environment
- **Traditional Setup**: Direct local development
- **[See all options ‚Üí](./docs/GETTING_STARTED.md)**

## üéØ For Developers & Learners

### Study the Prompt Engineering
```typescript
// See real prompt engineering in action
// File: /app/api/claude/coaching/route.ts

const coachingPrompt = `${personalityPrompt}

The player is considering the guess "${currentGuess}" for attempt ${guessCount + 1}.

Game state analysis:
- Previous guesses: ${guesses.join(', ')}
- Letters ruled out: ${Array.from(wrongLetters).join(', ')}
- Confirmed positions: ${correctLetters.map(c => `${c.letter} in position ${c.position}`).join(', ')}

WITHOUT revealing the target word, provide strategic coaching about this guess:
1. Is this strategically optimal given what they know?
2. Are they reusing ruled-out letters unnecessarily?
3. Could they make a more information-gathering guess?

Stay in character and keep under 100 words.`
```

### API Architecture
- **`/api/claude/generate-word`** - Theme-based word generation with difficulty control
- **`/api/claude/get-hint`** - Context-aware hints with progressive difficulty
- **`/api/claude/coaching`** - Real-time strategy analysis (feature-flagged)
- **`/api/claude/game-over`** - Post-game analysis and encouragement

### Cost Management & Production Ready
- Rate limiting (5 games/day per IP, 30 hints/hour)
- Feature flags for expensive operations
- Fallback responses for offline/error scenarios
- Caching strategies for repeated requests

## üöÄ Deployment

### Vercel (Recommended)
