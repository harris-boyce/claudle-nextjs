## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- Git knowledge
- An Anthropic API key ([get one here](https://console.anthropic.com/))
- Basic understanding of Next.js and React

### Setup for Development
```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub, then:
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/claudle-nextjs
cd claudle-nextjs
npm install

# Set up environment
cp .env.local.example .env.local
# Add your ANTHROPIC_API_KEY to .env.local

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

### Using the Tutorial Structure
Before contributing, explore our progressive tutorial:
```bash
# Start with the origin story
cat TUTORIAL-00-ARTIFACT-ORIGIN.md

# Explore the progression
git checkout tutorial-01-basic-game
git checkout tutorial-02-ai-integration
git checkout tutorial-03-prompt-engineering
# ... etc
```

## üìù Contribution Guidelines

### Educational Contributions

#### When Adding Tutorial Content:
- **Learning Objectives**: Clearly state what learners will understand
- **Practical Examples**: Include real code, not just theory
- **Progressive Difficulty**: Build on previous concepts
- **Authentic Value**: Don't overpromise what's actually delivered

#### When Documenting Prompts:
- **Show Context**: Explain why the prompt works
- **Include Game State**: Show how game data informs AI responses
- **Cost Considerations**: Mention API usage implications
- **Fallback Strategies**: Document error handling approaches

### Code Contributions

#### Prompt Engineering Standards:
```typescript
// ‚úÖ Good prompt structure
const coachingPrompt = `${personalityContext}

Game Analysis:
- Current state: ${gameState}
- Player context: ${playerContext}
- Constraints: ${constraints}

Task: ${specificTask}
Guidelines: ${guidelines}

Stay in character and be helpful.`

// ‚ùå Avoid vague prompts
const badPrompt = "Give a hint"
```

#### Code Quality Requirements:
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety required
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation for AI failures
- **Testing**: Add tests for new functionality
- **Performance**: Consider API cost and response time
- **Accessibility**: Follow WCAG guidelines

### Commit Message Format
```
type(scope): short description

Longer explanation if needed, focusing on educational impact.

Learning outcomes:
- What this teaches developers
- How it improves the educational experience
- Any prompt engineering patterns demonstrated
```

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `tutorial`, `prompt`, `test`, `refactor`

## üß™ Testing Your Contributions

### Before Submitting:
```bash
# Run all checks
npm run build        # Verify TypeScript compilation
