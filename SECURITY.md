## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously, especially given our integration with AI APIs and user data handling.

### What to Report
- Security vulnerabilities in the application code
- API key exposure or authentication issues
- Potential data privacy concerns
- Input validation vulnerabilities that could affect AI interactions
- Any security issues that could compromise user data or system integrity

### How to Report
Please **DO NOT** create public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, please email security concerns to: [repository owner's email - to be updated]

Include in your report:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact assessment
- Any suggested fixes (if you have them)

### Response Timeline
- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status Update**: Within 1 week
- **Resolution**: Varies based on complexity, but we aim for 30 days maximum

### What Happens Next
1. We'll acknowledge receipt of your report
2. We'll investigate and validate the vulnerability
3. We'll develop and test a fix
4. We'll coordinate disclosure and release timing with you
5. We'll credit you in our security acknowledgments (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)

## Security Best Practices

When contributing to ClaudLE:

### API Security
- Never commit API keys or sensitive credentials
- Use environment variables for all sensitive configuration
- Implement proper rate limiting for AI API calls
- Validate all inputs before sending to AI APIs

### User Data Protection
- Minimize data collection (we use privacy-first analytics)
- Don't log sensitive user information
- Implement proper session management
- Follow GDPR and privacy best practices

### Code Security
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Implement proper error handling that doesn't leak sensitive information
- Follow secure coding practices for web applications

## Educational Security

As an educational platform, we also prioritize:
- Teaching secure AI integration practices
- Demonstrating proper API key management
- Showing cost control and rate limiting techniques
- Providing examples of secure prompt engineering

## Dependencies

We regularly update dependencies to address security vulnerabilities. Contributors should:
- Keep dependencies up to date
- Review security advisories for used packages
- Use `npm audit` to check for known vulnerabilities

## Questions?

If you have questions about our security practices or policies, please create a GitHub issue with the `security` label for non-sensitive discussions.
